    "Hi, I’m Srinivas Mekala—an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for backend development, distributed systems, and creating scalable, reliable solutions. I enjoy diving into complex challenges, whether it’s designing efficient microservices, optimizing database performance, or building applications that make life easier (and sometimes cooler).",
    "I’ve honed my skills through hands-on experience working with cutting-edge technologies like Python, Flask, MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS. My journey has taken me from crafting real-time chat systems to integrating APIs from health insurers and even leading development for innovative projects like ArtKart and Chatopia",
    "Beyond coding, I’m a curious learner, mentor at Hackerabad, community organizer, and even dabbled in event management for CodeDay Hyderabad. When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring bakeries and cafe`s, watching movies, or trying to perfect the art of balancing coffee cups and deadlines. Let’s connect and build something amazing together!"
